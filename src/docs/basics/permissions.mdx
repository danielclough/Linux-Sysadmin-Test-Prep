Create and execute a script `/danielsTestDrills/perms/perms.sh` which sources the file `/danielsTestDrills/perms/vars` sets: 
	`$var0` with fully permissive read, write, and execute permissions. 
    `$var1` as owned by user toto and group oz 
    `$var2` with a sticky bit 
    `$var3` as suid 
    `$var4` as sgid 
    `$var5` with an ACL giving write permissions to toto 
    `$var6` as immutable 
    `$var7` as append only
    and echos "var# FAILED!" (eg. var7 FAILED!) in case of failure (hint: only one will fail if you do it right)

---

Search for files with the sticky bit set and change the name to `sticky`.

Search for files with the setgid permissions set and change the name to `setGID`.

Search for files with the setuid permissions set and change the name to `setUID`.

Search for all files executable by anyone and delete them.

Search all files readable by anyone and remove those permissions.

Search for the file with toto's ACL write permissions and append the filename into `/danielsTestDrills/tempFile`

Remove `/danielsTestDrills/tempFile`
