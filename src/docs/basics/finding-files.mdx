List all files in current and sub directories
`find`

Search specific directory or path
`find ./test`

The following command searches for files by their name.

`find ./test -name "abc.txt"`

We can also use wildcards

`find ./test -name "*.txt"`

Ignore the case

`find ./test -iname "*.txt"`

Limit depth of directory traversal
`find ./test -maxdepth 2 -name "*.txt"`
`find ./test -maxdepth 1 -name *.txt`

Invert match
`find ./test -not -name "*.txt"`
find ./test ! -name "*.txt"

Combine multiple search criterias
`find ./test -name 'abc*' ! -name '*.txt'`

OR operator
`find -name '*.txt' -o -name '*.txt'`

Search only files or only directories
`find ./test -name abc*`


Only files
`find ./test -type f -name "abc*"`
Only directories
`find ./test -type d -name "abc*"`

Search multiple directories together

`find ./test ./dir2 -type f -name "abc*"`

Find hidden files
`find ~ -type f -name ".*"`

Find files with certain permissions
`find . -type f -perm 0664`
`find . -type f ! -perm 0777`

10. Find files with sgid/suid bits set

# find / -perm 2644

`find / -maxdepth 2 -perm /u=s 2>/dev/null`

Find readonly files

Find all Read Only files.

`find /etc -maxdepth 1 -perm /u=r`

Find executable files
`find /bin -maxdepth 2 -perm /a=x`

Find files owned to particular user
`find . -user bob`

`find . -user bob -name '*.txt'`

# find /var/www -group developer


`find ~ -name "hidden.txt"`

Find files modified N days back

To find all the files which are modified 50 days back.

# find / -mtime 50


Find all files that were accessed in the last 50 days.

# find / -atime 50

Find files modified in a range of days

Find all files that were modified between 50 to 100 days ago.

# find / -mtime +50 â€“mtime -100

Find files changed in last N minutes.

Find files modified within the last 1 hour.

`find /home/bob -cmin -60`

1Files modified in last hour

To find all the files which are modified in last 1 hour.

# find / -mmin -60

20. Find Accessed Files in Last 1 Hour

To find all the files which are accessed in last 1 hour.

# find / -amin -60

Find files of given size

Search files and directories based on size. To find all 50MB files, use.

# find / -size 50M

Find files in a size range

To find all the files which are greater than 50MB and less than 100MB.

`find / -size +50M -size -100M`

Find largest and smallest files

The find command when used in combination with the ls and sort command can be used to list out the largest files.
The following command will display the 5 largest file in the current directory and its subdirectory. This may take a while to execute depending on the total number of files the command has to process.

`find . -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n -r | head -5`

Similary when sorted in ascending order, it would show the smallest files first

`find . -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n | head -5`

Find empty files and directories

The following command uses the "empty" option of the find command, which finds all files that are empty.

# find /tmp -type f -empty

To file all empty directories use the type "d".

`find ~/ -type d -empty`

Really very simple and easy
Some advanced operations

The find command not only finds files based on a certain criteria, it can also act upon those files using any linux command. For example, we might want to delete some files.

Here are some quick examples
2List out the found files

Lets say we found files using find command, and now want to list them out as the ls command would have done. This is very easy.

`find . -exec ls -ld {} \;`

Delete all matching files or directories

The following command will remove all text files in the tmp directory.

`find /tmp -type f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -f {} \;`

The same operating can be carried out with directories, just put type d, instead of type f.

Lets take another example where we want to delete files larger than 100MB

`find /home/bob/dir -type f -name *.log -size +10M -exec `rm -f {} \;
