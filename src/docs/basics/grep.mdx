  - Otherwise: 
    Save the file https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt to `/danielsTestDrills/quizfiles/GPL-3`
3. Download the word list:
  Save the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words.txt to `/danielsTestDrills/quizfiles/WORDS`
4. Run `quiz` with the argument `grep`
