### grep

`grep -r content -l / --exclude-dir=public` (recursive grep for content in / and list filename)

`grep -w word file.txt` (grep exact word)

`grep -v junk file.txt` (grep lines WITHOUT junk)

`grep "this\|that" file.txt` (grep for this OR that)

`grep -v junk file.txt | grep content` (grep for content without junk)

`grep cont.nt file.txt` (grep for word with unknown single character)

`grep [uo]n file.txt` (grep for un OR on)

`grep [^uo]n file.txt` (grep for anything before n except u and o)

`ls -l /etc | grep rc[0-9]` ( grep for numbered rc files in /etc; same result as using [[:digit:]])

`grep "kubelet\[[[:digit:]]\+\]" /var/log/syslog`

`grep "\([pP]ost\( *\|\-\)[mM]odern\)" file.txt` (grep post modern, post-modern, PostModern)

1. Create a symlink to the file `/danielsTestDrills/quizFiles/quiz` to a folder in your PATH.
2. Prepare the `GPL-3` file:
  - Assuming you are on Ubuntu:
    Locate the "GPL-3" license file and copy it to `/danielsTestDrills/GPL-3`.
  - Otherwise: 
    Save the file https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt to `/danielsTestDrills/quizFiles/GPL-3`
3. Download the word list:
  Save the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words.txt to `/danielsTestDrills/quizFiles/WORDS`
4. Run `quiz` with the argument `grep`
5. Run `quiz` with the argument `egrep`
