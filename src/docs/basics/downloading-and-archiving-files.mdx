### Quiz

- Create a directory in `/` called `LinuxTestDrills/downloads`.
    - The rest of the Quiz should be done in this folder. Remove files that are not part of the instructions if you make a mistake.

1. Download `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling#/media/File:Penrose_Tiling_(Rhombi).svg` and save it as `awesome.svg`
1. Download concatenate `linuxtest.danielc.us/downloads/topSite` and `linuxtest.danielc.us/downloads/secondTopSite` into a single file called `links`.
1. Download the sites in `links`. Open `index.html` with a web browser and click on one of the links.
1. Mirror `https://dizer.netlify.app/` with one level of recursion with links that you can browse it from your computer. Open it with a browser and click around.
1. Finish downloading with full recursion, and click around again.
1. Download `linuxtest.danielc.us/downloads/quizFiles/quiz` and `linuxtest.danielc.us/downloads/quizFiles/wget`.
1. Execute the command `quizFiles/quiz wget`

## tar

`tar -cf files.tar ​files/` (create tar from dir)

`tar tvf files.tar` (list files in tar)

`tar --delete -f files.tar file` (deletes file from tar)

`tar --update -f files.tar file` (adds file to tar)

`tar -jcf files.tar.bz2 files.tar` (create bz2 from tar)

`tar -Jcf files.tar.xz files/` (create tar.xz from dir)

`unzip files.zip -d files/` (unzip to dir)

`tar xf files.tar.bz2 -C <DIR> --same-permissions` (extract to dir)

`wget file.tar.xz -O - | tar xz` (Download and extract)

### Quiz


1. Archive `LinuxTestDrills/downloads` into a file `LinuxTestDrills/archives/downloads.tar`.
1. List the files in `LinuxTestDrills/archives/downloads.tar` to make sure you have only the correct files.
1. Download the file at `https://danielc.us/lfcs-prep/testFiles.tar.xz` to `LinuxTestDrills/downloads`and extract it into `/LinuxTestDrills`, in a single command, maintaining original ownership. You can change ownership as needed during the drills.
1. Add `LinuxTestDrills/downloads/testFiles.tar.xz` into `LinuxTestDrills/archives/downloads.tar` and delete everything in the folder `LinuxTestDrills/downloads`.
1. Compress `LinuxTestDrills/archives/downloads.tar` with `bz2`, `xz`, and `zip`. Look at the resulting files.
1. Run `quizFiles/checkQuiz1a.sh`
