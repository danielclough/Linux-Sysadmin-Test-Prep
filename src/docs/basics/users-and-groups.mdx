## Exercise

Create a new groups `oz`, `dogs`, `friends`.

Create a new user `toto` with the home directory `/home/noPlace/`, make sure they use the original Bourne Shell, make their primary group `oz`, and add `dogs` as an extra group. Set the initial password as `IHeartDorothy` which should expire immediately.

Give `oz` group members the ability to sudo without a password.

Login to the `toto` account You should be forced to set a new password, change it to anything. 

Create a script `/danielsTestDrills/cleanup.sh` that targets all files in `/danielsTestDrills/` except itself and `/danielsTestDrills/tempFile`, adds them to `/danielsTestDrills/answers/testFiles.tar`, lists the file names in `/danielsTestDrills/tempFile`, and then deletes them.

Run that script.

Append the `friends` group to `toto`'s account.

Exit the `toto` session.
