Most people, when we have a question or a problem, turn to a search engine reflexivly. This isn't a problem if you have access, sometimes you don't.

Perhaps the system is broken... or perhaps you are taking a certification exam that only allows use of system documentation.

## man

You probably know the command `man`, but I guess you can learn to use it better! If you don't know the answers to these problems don't search the internet - use `man`!


### Tips:

*While in a manual you can search for words using `/`.*

1. Search for and read about "match-case" in `man`'s manual.

*Use `n` to go to the next match in a search.*

2. Search for and read about "regex" in `man`'s manual.


### Quiz:

1. Print `man`'s help menu.

2. Display the short description of the `man` command.

3. Search the short descriptions of all manuals for the keyword "individual"

4. Search for "fantastic" in all manual pages. 

5. Where is config file that overides `man`'s default options?
